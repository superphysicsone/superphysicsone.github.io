      <description>1 The Tao is like the emptiness of a vessel. In our use of it, we must be on our guard against all fullness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things!

 Heaven and earth do not act from the impulse of any wish to be benevolent.  They deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with.   The sages do not act from any wish to be benevolent.  They deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.    2 The space between heaven and earth can be compared to a bellows.</description>
