They receive their forms according to the tao of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore, all things honour the Tao or True Nature, and exalt Its outflowing operation.\n2 This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is the result of a spontaneous tribute, and not any ordination.\n3 Thus, the Tao produces all things, nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them.\n4 It produces them and makes no claim of ownership of them. It carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so. It brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them.

Those successful people should be careful from start to end, to avoid being ruined.\n4 Therefore, the sage:\n desires what other men do not desire does not prize things difficult to get learns what other men do not learn turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by  Thus, he helps the natural development of all things.

In this way, the cooking up of criticism will not produce a bad smell.\nIt is not that the cooking does not produce smells, but that the smells will not hurt men.\nIt is not that the smells could hurt men, but because the ruling sage will not use it to hurt them.\n3 When the ruler and his subjects do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue of the Tao or True Nature.\nChapter 61: Federalism 1 What makes a state great is its being like a low-lying, down-flowing stream. It becomes the centre to which tend all the small states under heaven.\n2 This is shown by females. The female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered a sort of abasement.\n3 Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself. Here, the abasement leads to gaining adherents.\nSmall states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. Here, the abasement leads to procuring favour.\n4 The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them. A small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.
